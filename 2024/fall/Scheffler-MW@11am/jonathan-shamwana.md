## The Haiku
Feet pound, miles ahead,  
Chemex brews in morning light,  
Fashion flows like wind.

## 5 things I can't leave the house without
1.  **A briefcase full of cash:** Just to buy a coffee. Hyperinflation's bad out in BA.
2. **Coffee beans:** never know when you'll have to pull out the Chemex and brew some coffee.
3. **Baggy trousers:** if they can't fit too legs in each leg-hole, I don't want em.
4. **An afro comb** micro-aggressions are trending, you never know when someone will touch your hair because they were curious
5. **Food**: move a lot, gotta eat a lot.

## A song lyric I like
*"You can't fathom my love, dude*  
*Lock yourself in a room.*  
*Do five beats a day for three summers*  
*That's a different world like Cree's summers*  
*I deserve to do these numbers"*
