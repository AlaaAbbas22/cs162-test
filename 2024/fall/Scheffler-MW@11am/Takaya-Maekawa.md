## About Me

Hello! I'm **Takaya Maekawa**, a student at _Minerva University_ majoring in **Computer Science**.

I was born and raised in the beautiful country of **Japan**, where the sushi is plentiful and the technology is cutting-edge. When I'm not studying the intricacies of algorithms or debugging lines of code, you can find me indulging in my favorite pastime: **football** (the one where you actually use your feet, not hands!). ⚽️

### A Few Fun Facts About Me:

- I'm a **coding wizard** by day, a **football enthusiast** by night.
- I dream of creating the next _AI-powered_ football coach.
- I can juggle **three soccer balls** while solving a **Sudoku** puzzle (okay, maybe not, but I’m working on it).

### My Journey So Far:

- Grew up in **Tokyo, Japan**, where my love for technology blossomed.
- Joined **Minerva University**, where I'm diving deep into the world of computer science.
- Still looking for the perfect balance between the **art of coding** and the **science of football**.

### What’s Next?

- Building an AI to predict football match outcomes (and maybe win some friendly bets!).
- Becoming a **world-class software engineer** and a **football coach** (because why not both?).

_In conclusion_, I’m on a mission to merge my two passions, and who knows? Maybe one day you'll be watching a football match where the players are robots, and I’ll be the one writing their playbook.
