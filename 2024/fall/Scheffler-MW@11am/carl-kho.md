>*I told AI to make my LinkedIn whimsical and markdown-ed it myself haha*

**It all started with a bang!** 💥 Well, not really, but it sounds more exciting that way. 😉

I'm Carl. [I contribute to OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/pull/1271#pullrequestreview-2251214927) in my spare time. I say that to sound cool but it's honestly still pending.

My adventures have taken me across continents, allowing me to immerse myself in **7 different countries** during my college years.

I thrive on challenges, whether it's:

* **Gamifying financial education** to empower the less privileged 💰
* Using the power of **AI to combat bias** in media 📰
* Or simply finding innovative solutions to everyday problems 🤔

**Languages:**

* 🗣️ English (Native)
* 🗣️ Filipino (Native)
* 🗣️ Cebuano (Native)

But beyond the accolades and accomplishments, I'm just a curious soul on a quest to make a meaningful impact on the world, one pixel, one line of code, one act of kindness at a time.

**Let's connect and create something extraordinary together!** ✨
