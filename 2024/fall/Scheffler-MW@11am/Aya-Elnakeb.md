# Aya

**Hi, I’m Aya!**  
I’m a developer who loves solving puzzles and building cool projects. When I’m not coding, you can find me:

* Watching movies 
* Shopping
* travelling

> *"No Risk, No Fun."* - Me

## Fun Facts:
1. My idea of relaxation involves lounging with a bowl of salty snacks and letting the world sway away.
2. I’m obsessed with learning about AI and Robotics.
3. I love celebrating my birthday with different themes each year, always featuring unique characters and decorations.
