> "It is not a bug, it is a feature." - Somebody, probably

If you ask me why I am in this course, I would just tell you that I want to be like the guy in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SQYNa7ZjuDQ), who is simply a ***10x engineer***. I like coding stuff with my best-friends in my free time. Actually, we are currently working on a splitwise-on-Telegram type of application which I think many people will enjoy in Minerva. Here are some things I enjoy:

* Playing drums (Drummer of 10+ years) and guitar
* Writing and reading stories (I have a book!) and drawing things (I recently got interested in tattoo designing)
* Philosophy and anything that involves argumentation
* Drama (I directed my own crews in Turkey too!)

Now, you might ask if I am an AH student, however, the answer is a ~~no~~. In my professional ventures, I also like `coding things` which make my life easier, or bring me joy. Here are some of the things I have done:

* [X] 3x Hackathon Winner
  * [X] With an LSTM ML algo for predicting seizures
  * [X] Bias mitigating neutral newsletter
  * [X] Blockchain App for Sustainability
* [X] Random Project Builder
  * [X] CourseExpert (A course path builder using cosine similarities and pathfinding algorithms)
  * [X] Activity recommender (based on previous activities)
  * [X] Customer Health-Success Models on Realtime Data (For my internship)
  * [ ] Telegram Expense Tracker (Currently building it)

Since we seem to have used enough markdowns as requested, here are some fun facts about me.

1. *I do not have a spine* (Yes, I broke it a few years ago because I fell down off a mountain)
2. *I am 23 years old and people still ask me for IDs*
3. *I am in love with stats and my best friend roasts me about it on the daily*
4. *I want to be a quant, or a fintech bro (yes, I know ðŸ˜­ ðŸ’¸)*
5. *I am ethnically Greek + Turkish and yes, both sides LOVE each other*

Anyways, nice to meet y'all, hope this entry was quirky and funny as it was requested in the preclasswork. Otherwise, I am not funny at all, you can test.
