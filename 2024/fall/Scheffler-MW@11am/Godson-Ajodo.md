# Godson Ajodo's Biography
Hello, My name is Godson Ajodo. I'm currently a junior at <b>Minerva University </b>. I'm a Computer Science Major, with extreme love for ***Competitive programmming*** (was really good at it before I took a long break) and working my way around data and its science.  
Few (or many) would know me for being an anime and comics lover. My favorite genres are Action, Fantasy, Psychologial, Supernatural, System, and Isekai. 
I love playing chess as well. You can always find me playing a game ro solving puzzles. 

I was a data engineering intern at Microsoft (Xbox) last summer, and I absolutely loved my role as I get to spend more time with data, writing logics and building pipelines. 

My other interests ðŸš€ are: 
- Machine Learning
- Game Development
- Software Engineering (Getting into this lately)
- Dark Poetry
